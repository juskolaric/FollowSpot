# Videos of working algorithms

#### Face detection (viola jones) - follow spot
In this video, whole process in GUI is shown. From clicking the corners to get koordinates, to generating grid, where spotlight will go, to tracking.

#### Boosting algorithm - follow spot
1 of 8 algorithms. Worked well

#### Boosting algorithm - follow spot with colors
Changing colors of light and dimmer

#### MIL algorithm - follow spot
2 of 8 algorithm.

#### KCF algorithm - follow spot
3 of 8 algorithm.  
Not great - no video

#### TLD algorithm - follow spot
4 of 8 algorithm. Worst in our case. A little change of brightness made problems.

#### GoTurn algorithm - follow spot
6 of 8 algorithm:  
No video. Wasn't working good at all for our needs.  

#### MOSSE algorithm - follow spot
7 of 8 algorithm.

#### CSRT algorithm - follow spot
8 of 8 algorithm. Most reliable of bunch. Tracked ok even when there was a change of lighting on the face of person beeing tracked

#### CSRT algorithm - follow spot
With changing colors
